### Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction x Kaggle Challenge üìà

#### **1. Project Requirements:**

The task is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast short-term volatility of hundreds of stocks across various sectors. Volatility, in financial terms, refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time as measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns. In simpler terms, it measures how wildly prices swing up and down. This project requires handling and analyzing highly granular financial data‚Äîspecifically, hundreds of millions of rows detailing stock movements over 10-minute periods.

üîç **Why Predicting Volatility?**

For trading firms like Optiver, predicting volatility is crucial for effectively trading options. Options are financial derivatives that provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a certain date. The price of options is largely influenced by the volatility of the asset it's based on‚Äîthe more uncertain the asset's price, the higher the potential payoff for the option holder, and thus, the more valuable the option.
