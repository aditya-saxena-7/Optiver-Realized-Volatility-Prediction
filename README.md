### Abstract
📉 In this study, we endeavor to predict short-term volatility in stock prices, utilizing high-resolution financial data from the Nasdaq-Closing-Price-Prediction Challenge hosted by Optiver on Kaggle. Our models forecast the realized volatility over 10-minute intervals for various stocks across multiple sectors. By employing advanced quantitative techniques and machine learning algorithms on order book and trades data, this research aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of volatility predictions. These predictions are vital for the pricing of options and other derivative products. The effectiveness of our models is assessed using the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE).

### Introduction
🌍 The dynamic nature of financial markets makes understanding and predicting short-term price movements a crucial aspect of financial risk management and trading. Particularly, the prediction of realized volatility—over short intervals such as 10 minutes—plays a pivotal role in the structuring and pricing of financial derivatives. This project taps into the rich dataset provided by the Nasdaq-Closing-Price-Prediction Challenge, which offers detailed insights into the microstructure of financial markets through one-second snapshots of order book and executed trades. 

By focusing on these high-frequency data points, our research seeks not only to develop robust predictive models but also to contribute to the broader field of financial analytics by improving the precision of short-term volatility forecasts. These forecasts are integral to a myriad of financial decisions, influencing everything from day trading strategies to the hedging of complex financial portfolios.

### Literature Review
📚 The concept of realized volatility has been extensively explored in financial literature, with significant contributions underscoring its importance in risk management and derivative pricing. Pioneering studies by Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) introduced the use of high-frequency data to estimate volatility more accurately than traditional models. Subsequent research has built upon these foundations, integrating machine learning techniques to further enhance prediction accuracy. For example, recent studies have employed methods like Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines to predict stock price movements based on historical volatility patterns (Brooks, 2014). These studies highlight the evolving nature of financial analytics and the increasing reliance on granular, high-frequency trading data to capture the nuances of market dynamics.

### Methodology
🔍 Our methodology centers around a quantitative analysis of the order book and trade execution data provided by the Optiver dataset. We begin with data preprocessing to handle anomalies and missing values, ensuring a clean dataset for model training. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in our approach, as we extract meaningful indicators from the raw data such as moving averages, price velocity, and order book imbalances. These features aim to capture the intricacies of market behavior that influence short-term volatility.

### Model Development
🧠 We deploy a multi-model framework to forecast short-term volatility, leveraging both traditional statistical models and advanced machine learning algorithms. Initially, we implement an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to establish a baseline using historical volatility patterns. To capture more complex patterns in the data, we integrate machine learning models including:
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: To handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**: These networks are designed to extract layered features and interactions in the data, which are not readily apparent. The architecture of the DNN is fine-tuned to optimize performance and minimize overfitting, incorporating dropout layers and regularization techniques.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks**: Particularly suited for time-series data, LSTMs can capture temporal dependencies and long-range patterns in the data sequence that are critical for predicting short-term changes.

Each model's performance is rigorously evaluated using a validation set, and ensemble techniques are employed to combine the strengths of individual models, thereby enhancing the overall predictive accuracy. The final model selection is guided by the RMSPE, ensuring that the chosen model not only fits the training data well but also generalizes effectively to unseen data.
