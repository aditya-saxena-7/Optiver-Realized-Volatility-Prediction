#### **1. Project Requirements:**
---
The task is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast short-term volatility of hundreds of stocks across various sectors. Volatility, in financial terms, refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time as measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns. In simpler terms, it measures how wildly prices swing up and down. This project requires handling and analyzing highly granular financial data‚Äîspecifically, hundreds of millions of rows detailing stock movements over 10-minute periods.

üîç **Why Predicting Volatility?**  
---
For trading firms like Optiver, predicting volatility is crucial for effectively trading options. Options are financial derivatives that provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a certain date. The price of options is largely influenced by the volatility of the asset it's based on‚Äîthe more uncertain the asset's price, the higher the potential payoff for the option holder, and thus, the more valuable the option.

#### **2. Importance of the Project:**
---
This project is essential because accurate volatility predictions allow trading firms to set more accurate prices for options, leading to fairer trading and improved market efficiency. Improved predictions can help mitigate risks associated with large price fluctuations and enhance the firm's ability to strategize effectively in turbulent markets.

üåê **Enhancing Market Stability:**  
---
By refining how volatility is predicted, Optiver contributes to more stable and reliable financial markets. This leads to better access and prices for options, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), equities, bonds, and foreign currencies, benefiting a wide array of market participants from large institutional investors to individual traders.

#### **3. How the Project is to be Conducted:**
---
Participants will need to design, implement, and validate their predictive models using the provided dataset from Kaggle, a platform hosting data science competitions. The models will be assessed based on their ability to accurately predict volatility over future 10-minute periods, with evaluations made against real market data collected during the competition.
