### üîç Abstract

---

Volatility is one of the most prominent terms you‚Äôll hear on any trading floor ‚Äì and for good reason. In financial markets, volatility captures the amount of fluctuation in prices. High volatility is associated to periods of market turbulence and to large price swings, while low volatility describes more calm and quiet markets. For trading firms like Optiver, accurately predicting volatility is essential for the trading of options, whose price is directly related to the volatility of the underlying product.

As a leading global electronic market maker, Optiver is dedicated to continuously improving financial markets, creating better access and prices for options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds and foreign currencies on numerous exchanges around the world. Optiver‚Äôs teams have spent countless hours building sophisticated models that predict volatility and continuously generate fairer options prices for end investors. However, an industry-leading pricing algorithm can never stop evolving, and there is no better place than Kaggle to help Optiver take its model to the next level.

In the first three months of this competition, you‚Äôll build models that predict short-term volatility for hundreds of stocks across different sectors. You will have hundreds of millions of rows of highly granular financial data at your fingertips, with which you'll design your model forecasting volatility over 10-minute periods. Your models will be evaluated against real market data collected in the three-month evaluation period after training.

Through this competition, you'll gain invaluable insight into volatility and financial market structure. You'll also get a better understanding of the sort of data science problems Optiver has faced for decades. We look forward to seeing the creative approaches the Kaggle community will apply to this ever complex but exciting trading challenge. üìà

### üåç Introduction

---

The inherently dynamic nature of financial markets necessitates a profound understanding and precise prediction of short-term price fluctuations, pivotal for effective financial risk management and trading strategies. Specifically, the prediction of realized volatility within concise intervals, such as 10 minutes, is essential for the strategic structuring and accurate pricing of financial derivatives. This project leverages the comprehensive dataset from the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction, on Kaggle, which provides intricate insights into the microstructure of the financial markets captured through one-second snapshots of order book data and executed trades.

üöÄ Focusing on these high-frequency data points, our research endeavors to forge robust predictive models and simultaneously enrich the broader field of financial analytics by refining the accuracy of short-term volatility forecasts. Such forecasts are crucial, underpinning a wide array of financial decisions that range from day trading strategies to the hedging of intricate financial portfolios, thereby enhancing the decision-making processes within dynamic market environments. üìà

### üìö Literature Review

---

The concept of realized volatility has been thoroughly explored within the realm of financial literature, with seminal contributions emphasizing its pivotal role in risk management and the pricing of derivatives. Notably, the groundbreaking studies by [Andersen and Bollerslev (1998)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209620) pioneered the utilization of high-frequency trading data to estimate volatility with greater precision than traditional models. This innovative approach has laid the foundation for subsequent research, which has increasingly integrated sophisticated machine learning techniques to further refine prediction accuracy.

üåê Building upon these academic pillars, more recent inquiries have implemented advanced computational methods such as [Random Forests](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6849-3_12), [Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7849326), and [Support Vector Machines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719) to predict stock price movements based on historical volatility patterns, as explored by Brooks in 2014. These contemporary studies underscore the dynamic evolution of financial analytics and highlight an increasing dependency on fine-grained, high-frequency trading data to capture the subtle nuances of market dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding and capabilities in financial analysis. üìä

#### Competition Format and Predictive Task

The Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition poses a unique challenge centered on predicting the short-term realized volatility of stocks over a 10-minute window using high-frequency trading data. Let's break down the core elements of this task:

**Realized Volatility (RV) Formula**:  
The key metric of interest, Realized Volatility, is computed as:
\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{t} r_{t-1,t}^2} \]
Here, \( r_{t-1,t} \) represents the log returns of stock prices at consecutive time points, and the formula calculates the standard deviation of these log returns. Notably, the calculation assumes a zero mean return and omits any scaling factor, simplifying the volatility estimation to focus purely on the magnitude of price fluctuations without averaging.

**Evaluation Metric**:
The accuracy of the predictions is assessed using the Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), defined as:
\[ \text{RMSPE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)}{y_i}\right)^2} \]
This metric evaluates the percentage errors relative to the actual values, emphasizing the proportional accuracy of the predictions across different stock price scales.

**Data Scale and Utilization**:  
Participants are provided with a massive dataset consisting of approximately 150,000 data points across 112 stocks. Each data point represents a 10-minute window of trading activity, capturing intricate details of market movements. The predictive models utilize order book and transaction data from the preceding 10-minute window to forecast the upcoming volatility.

#### Model Training and Evaluation Process

The competition format is structured to simulate real-world trading scenarios, where timely and accurate predictions are crucial:

1. **Model Development**: During the initial phase, participants can experiment with various modeling techniques, refine their strategies, and submit predictions as frequently as desired. This phase allows for iterative learning and model optimization based on immediate feedback from the competition platform.

2. **Live Validation**: Post the development phase, a fixed model is used to predict unseen market data over a subsequent three-month period. This live test phase prohibits model adjustments, thus mimicking a real trading environment where algorithms must perform robustly against future data without the possibility for real-time tuning.

3. **Competition Outcome**: The final performance of each participant's model is determined after the live validation period, ensuring that all models are tested impartially and rigorously against actual market developments.

### Key Challenges and Considerations

Participants must address several challenges inherent in this task:

- **Handling High-Frequency Data**: The models must efficiently process and extract useful patterns from vast amounts of granular data within limited time frames.
- **Accuracy under Market Volatility**: Ensuring prediction accuracy in diverse market conditions, including periods of high volatility and unpredictable market events.
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Developing a model that generalizes well to new data, avoiding overfitting to historical data used during the model development phase.

This competition format not only tests participants' ability to develop advanced predictive models but also their skill in creating strategies that are adaptable and resilient in the dynamic landscape of financial markets.

### Understanding Order Book Data

<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(799).png" width=80%>

#### Overview of Order Book Data

In the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition, the primary dataset provided is the **Order Book** data. This dataset is critical for understanding market dynamics and is essential for predicting short-term volatility. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at what order book data encompasses and how it's utilized in this context:

**Definition**:  
An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument, organized by price level. It provides a real-time snapshot of market liquidity and is used to gauge potential future movements in the market.

**Components of an Order Book**:
- **Bid**: The bid prices represent the maximum price that buyers are willing to pay for the security. Each bid price is associated with a specific quantity of shares, referred to as the bid size.
- **Ask**: Conversely, the ask prices are the minimum prices at which sellers are willing to sell the security, each accompanied by an ask size.

The data snapshot in the image illustrates how bid and ask information is presented at various price levels, capturing the depth and range of market sentiment.

#### Data Structure and Key Variables

**Columns in Order Book Data**:
- **Price Levels (BidPrice1, AskPrice1, BidPrice2, AskPrice2, etc.)**: These columns represent various price points at which market participants are willing to buy (bid) or sell (ask). The '1' denotes the most competitive (closest to the current market price) bid and ask prices, while '2' represents the next best available prices.
- **Size Levels (BidSize1, AskSize1, BidSize2, AskSize2, etc.)**: These columns correspond to the number of shares available at each of the price points mentioned above.

This structured data format allows traders and algorithms to quickly assess the market's supply and demand dynamics at multiple price levels, providing a granular view of market liquidity.

#### Calculating Weighted Average Price (WAP)

To predict volatility from order book data, one needs to derive a price that best represents the market conditions at any given moment. The Weighted Average Price (WAP) is used for this purpose and is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{WAP} = \frac{\text{BidPrice}_i \times \text{AskSize}_i + \text{AskPrice}_i \times \text{BidSize}_i}{\text{BidSize}_i + \text{AskSize}_i} \]

**Example**:
Using the formula, the WAP takes into account both the price and the size of bids and asks, providing a price point that reflects both the depth of the market and the existing trading volume.

#### From WAP to Volatility

**Log Returns**:
Once the WAP is calculated, the next step involves computing the log returns. Log returns are a standard measure in finance for calculating the relative changes in price over time and are expressed as:
\[ r_{t_1, t_2} = \log \left( \frac{S_2}{S_1} \right) \]
where \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are the WAPs at two consecutive time points.

**Realized Volatility**:
Finally, realized volatility is calculated using the formula introduced earlier:
\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{t} r_{t-1,t}^2} \]
This measure captures the standard deviation of log returns, providing a quantitative measure of the market's volatility over a specified period.

### Understanding Volatility Calculation with Log Returns

**Volatility** measures how much the price of a financial asset fluctuates over a certain period. In simpler terms, it's a way to quantify the risk or uncertainty about the asset's price changes. Here's how the given formula works and why it effectively measures volatility:

#### The Formula: 
\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{t} r_{t-1,t}^2} \]

- **\( \sigma \)**: This represents the volatility.
- **\( r_{t-1,t} \)**: These are the log returns of the stock prices between consecutive time points.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Log Returns**:
   - **Definition**: The log return \( r_{t-1,t} \) for a given time period from \( t-1 \) to \( t \) is calculated as:
     \[ r_{t-1,t} = \log \left( \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} \right) \]
     where \( P_t \) and \( P_{t-1} \) are the stock prices at time \( t \) and \( t-1 \) respectively.
   - **Purpose**: Log returns are used because they make the data more stable and easier to handle mathematically, especially when dealing with compounding returns over time.

2. **Summing Squared Log Returns**:
   - **Square Each Log Return**: Squaring each log return magnifies the impact of larger fluctuations while ensuring all values are positive.
   - **Sum of Squared Log Returns**: Summing these squared values gives us a measure of the total variability in the stock price over the observed period.

3. **Square Root of the Sum**:
   - **Why Square Root**: Taking the square root of the sum of squared log returns converts our measure back to the original scale of the log returns, making it comparable to the standard deviation (a common measure of variability).

#### Intuition Behind the Formula:

- **Log Returns Reflect Price Changes**: By using log returns, we capture the relative changes in stock prices over consecutive time periods. 
- **Squaring and Summing Magnifies Variability**: Squaring the log returns emphasizes larger price changes (more volatility) and summing them aggregates the total variability.
- **Square Root Normalizes the Measure**: The square root brings the measure back to a scale comparable to the standard deviation, giving us a clear sense of the average volatility.

#### Example:

Let's say we have the following stock prices over four time points: \( P_0 = 100 \), \( P_1 = 105 \), \( P_2 = 102 \), and \( P_3 = 108 \).

1. **Calculate Log Returns**:
   - \( r_{0,1} = \log \left( \frac{105}{100} \right) \approx 0.04879 \)
   - \( r_{1,2} = \log \left( \frac{102}{105} \right) \approx -0.02956 \)
   - \( r_{2,3} = \log \left( \frac{108}{102} \right) \approx 0.05827 \)

2. **Square Each Log Return**:
   - \( r_{0,1}^2 \approx 0.00238 \)
   - \( r_{1,2}^2 \approx 0.00087 \)
   - \( r_{2,3}^2 \approx 0.00340 \)

3. **Sum of Squared Log Returns**:
   - Sum \( = 0.00238 + 0.00087 + 0.00340 \approx 0.00665 \)

4. **Square Root of the Sum**:
   - \( \sigma = \sqrt{0.00665} \approx 0.08154 \)

#### Interpretation:

- The calculated volatility \( \sigma \approx 0.08154 \) means that the stock's price fluctuations are relatively small over the observed period.
- This measure gives us a standardized way to compare volatility across different stocks or time periods.

#### Understanding Trade Data
---
<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(800).png" width=80%>

#### Overview of Trade Data

While the primary focus of the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition is on order book data, the trade data provided also plays a crucial role in modeling and forecasting market dynamics. This dataset captures the actual transactions that have occurred, providing a snapshot of executed trades.

**Key Aspects of Trade Data**:
- **Trade Execution**: Trade data records the finalized transactions where a buyer and a seller have agreed on a price and exchanged the security. Unlike the order book, which represents potential market actions, trade data reflects actual market activity.
- **Components**: Each entry in the trade dataset typically includes:
  - **Price**: The price at which the trade was executed.
  - **Size**: The number of shares or units traded.
  - **Order Count**: The number of individual orders that were aggregated to result in the total traded size at the listed price.

#### Example Data Structure

The provided image and description illustrate a typical structure of trade data:

- **time_id**: Identifies the time window the trade belongs to.
- **seconds_in_bucket**: Indicates the seconds past the start of the bucket (or window) when the trade occurred.
- **price**: The execution price of the trades.
- **size**: The number of shares involved in the trades.
- **order_count**: The count of separate trading orders that contributed to the aggregate volume reported.

This structured format allows participants to analyze the frequency, volume, and nature of trades within the specific time windows relevant to the competition's prediction tasks.

#### Relevance to Volatility Prediction

**Integration with Order Book Data**:
While order book data offers insights into potential price movements and market liquidity, trade data provides concrete evidence of how these possibilities materialize into real transactions. This helps in understanding the impact of market orders on price changes and liquidity consumption.

**From Trade Data to Volatility**:
- **Price Impact**: By examining the executed prices and sizes, analysts can infer the immediate impact of trades on market prices. Large trades at prices significantly different from recent WAPs (Weighted Average Prices) might indicate market moves that could affect volatility.
- **Market Activity**: Frequent trading or large aggregate trading volumes within short windows can be indicative of higher volatility. Conversely, sparse or small trades might suggest a less volatile market.

<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(802).png" width=80%>

### Stages in the Pipeline

1. **Feature Engineering**: This initial stage involves creating predictive variables from the raw data that are more effective or informative than the raw data alone. In the context of financial data like order book and trade data, feature engineering could involve calculating statistical summaries (mean, variance), indicators (moving averages), or transformations (logarithmic returns, weighted average prices) that capture underlying trends or patterns relevant for predicting volatility.

2. **Model Integration**: The feature-engineered data is then fed into three distinct models:
    - **Gradient Boosting**
    - **Neural Network (MLP - Multi-Layer Perceptron)**
    - **TabNet (Deep Learning model for tabular data)**
   
3. **Regression (Meta-Modeling)**: Outputs from each of the three models are combined using a regression model that learns to optimally weight the predictions from each primary model to produce a final prediction. This approach leverages the strengths of each model to improve overall prediction accuracy.

### Importance and Relevance

- **Feature Engineering**: Essential for reducing model complexity and enhancing model performance by providing refined inputs that are directly relevant to the target variable (volatility in this case).
- **Model Integration**: Using multiple models allows the capture of different aspects and patterns in the data, possibly reducing the risk of overfitting to the noise in a single modeling approach.
- **Regression (Meta-Model)**: Combines the different predictive signals from each model into a single, more accurate and robust prediction. This step is crucial as it harmonizes the diverse strengths of individual models, mitigating their respective weaknesses.

## Detailed Analysis of Each Model

### 1. Gradient Boosting

- **Pros**:
  - **Efficiency**: Gradient Boosting is generally very fast, especially with implementations like LightGBM.

### 3. TabNet

- **Pros**:
  - **State-of-the-art**: Incorporates techniques from the successful Transformer architecture to handle tabular data.
  - **Interpretability**: Offers some level of interpretability similar to decision trees by using attention across different features.

- **Cons**:
  - **Complexity**: More complex to set up and tune compared to more traditional models.
  - **Data Sensitivity**: May not always outperform simpler models unless carefully tuned and trained with sufficient data.

### Comparative Advantages and Choice of LightGBM

Choosing **LightGBM** among other gradient boosting options might be motivated by the following:

- **Speed**: LightGBM is designed to be faster and more efficient, particularly in handling large datasets, due to its histogram-based optimizations.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Uses less memory and handles large amounts of data more efficiently.
- **Handling Categorical Features**: Effective in managing categorical data directly without the need for extensive preprocessing.

## Explanation of Basic Features for Volatility Prediction
---

<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(803).png" width=80%>

The features described are crucial for creating a predictive model for financial volatility based on high-frequency order book and trade data. Each feature captures different aspects of market behavior and dynamics, which can significantly influence the model's accuracy and performance. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of each feature and its importance:

### Features Based on the Order Book

1. **Weighted Average Price (WAP)**: 
   - **Definition**: A price metric that considers both the price and the quantity (size) of bids and asks. It is calculated as: \[ \text{WAP} = \frac{\text{BidPrice} \times \text{AskSize} + \text{AskPrice} \times \text{BidSize}}{\text{BidSize} + \text{AskSize}} \]
   - **Relevance**: Provides a balanced view of the market's buying and selling pressures at a specific time, reflecting the price at which most trading could occur.

2. **Log Return**:
   - **Definition**: The logarithmic difference between successive prices, commonly used to stabilize the variance of financial time series. \[ \text{Log Return} = \log\left(\frac{\text{Price}_{t}}{\text{Price}_{t-1}}\right) \]
   - **Relevance**: Helps in quantifying the price changes in a way that adjustments for compounding and asymmetries in positive and negative movements are considered.

3. **Volatility**:
   - **Definition**: A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Typically, higher volatility means higher risk.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for risk management in trading and investment strategies, as it provides an estimate of the potential price range of an asset in a given time frame.

4. **Volume and Volume Imbalance**:
   - **Definition**: Volume indicates the number of shares traded in a particular period. Volume imbalance measures the difference between the volume of buy orders and sell orders.
   - **Relevance**: High trading volume can indicate a high interest in a stock, potentially leading to larger price changes. Volume imbalance can signal the direction of the market movement based on dominant trading interest (buying vs. selling).

5. **Bid-Ask Spread**:
   - **Definition**: The difference between the highest bid (buy price) and the lowest ask (sell price).
   - **Relevance**: A narrower spread often indicates a more liquid market, whereas a wider spread can signal higher transaction costs and lower liquidity.

### Smoothing Techniques

- **Moving Averages / Moving Standard Deviation**:
  - **Definition**: These are statistical operations applied to time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.
  - **Relevance**: They help in understanding underlying trends in the data by damping down the noise of random fluctuations. This is crucial for detecting trends in financial markets where recent changes might be more indicative of future movements.

### Change Detection in Time Series

- **Change Metrics**:
  - **Definition**: Statistical calculations designed to identify significant changes or breaks in a time series, such as differences in volume or price over specified intervals.
  - **Relevance**: Critical for capturing shifts in market conditions, which could be indicative of events or changes in trader behavior, affecting volatility.

### Levels of Information

- **Stock x Time Level, Stock Level, Time Level**:
  - **Definition**: Different granularities of data aggregation ‚Äî from individual stocks at specific times to broader averages across stocks or time periods.
  - **Relevance**: These features allow models to capture both micro-level fluctuations specific to particular stocks and macro-level trends affecting the entire market or segments of the market over time. 

## Finding New Ideas for Feature Extraction

In competitive modeling environments like the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction challenge, the standard features‚Äîsuch as volume, volatility, and bid-ask spreads‚Äîare often used by many competitors. To gain an edge, it becomes essential to think outside the box or to implement innovative methods that other competitors might not be considering. This often involves exploring new ways to extract meaningful features from the data that capture the underlying patterns or trends not immediately obvious through conventional methods.

## Introduction to Autoencoders
---

<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(804).png" width=80%>

### What Are Autoencoders?

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. An autoencoder learns to compress (encode) the input into a lower-dimensional code and then reconstruct (decode) the output back to the original input.

### How Autoencoders Work

The typical architecture of an autoencoder includes three main parts:
1. **Encoder**: This part of the network compresses the input into a smaller representation.
2. **Code**: This is the lower-dimensional representation of the input data.
3. **Decoder**: This part attempts to reconstruct the input data from the code, ideally as close to the original input as possible.

The aim is to minimize the difference between the input and the output, which encourages the code to retain as much meaningful information about the input data as possible.

## LSTM Autoencoders for Time Series Data

### What is LSTM?

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are a building block for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). An LSTM is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, which are prone to forget earlier information in the input data, making them ineffective for long sequences. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies in data, which makes them particularly useful for time series analysis where such dependencies are common.

### Why Choose LSTM for Autoencoders in Time Series?

1. **Pattern and Shape Recognition**: LSTMs are well-suited for learning from sequences where the order of data points is important. They can recognize patterns or changes in patterns over time, making them ideal for time series data where the goal is to capture inherent trends that are predictive of future movements.

2. **Handling Time Series Data**: In financial markets, data points are often not independent but are instead a sequence where the past is indicative of the future to some extent. LSTMs can process such data effectively and can be used in autoencoders to both compress and reconstruct the time series data accurately.

### Implementation and Its Relevance

In the model depicted, the LSTM autoencoder is configured to:
- Initially compress a multi-feature time series into a lower-dimensional representation.
- Then expand it back out to reconstruct the original input.

This process helps in extracting the most crucial features from the sequence, encapsulating the information in fewer dimensions while maintaining the sequence's dynamics.

### Pros of Using LSTM Autoencoders

- **Efficient Information Capture**: Can compress information without losing critical temporal dynamics.
- **Pattern Learning**: Especially good at capturing and learning from the patterns in time series data.

### Cons of Using LSTM Autoencoders

- **Complexity in Training**: They are generally more complex and computationally expensive to train compared to simpler models.
- **Need for Down-Sampling**: To manage computational resources effectively, it might be necessary to down-sample the input data, which could potentially lead to loss of some finer details in the data.

### Conclusion

Using LSTM Autoencoders allows for a deep and nuanced understanding of time series data, making them a powerful tool in financial predictions where the dataset is large and complex. However, the trade-off includes increased computational demand and complexity in model tuning and training. Such sophisticated methods are often necessary in competitive environments to achieve superior performance by capturing subtle patterns missed by conventional models.

### Overview of LSTM AutoEncoder Performance

The LSTM AutoEncoder is designed to extract and compress time series data into a more manageable form while preserving essential information about the underlying patterns. The side-by-side comparison of original and reconstructed time series data (blue and orange lines, respectively) provides insight into the model's ability to capture various types of patterns in financial time series data.

### Observations from the LSTM AutoEncoder

1. **Simple Patterns and Macro Trends**:
   - **Effectiveness**: The LSTM AutoEncoder effectively captures straightforward and long-term trends in the time series data. This is visible where the orange (reconstructed) line closely follows the blue (original) line in smoother segments of the charts.
   - **Application**: This ability is particularly useful in financial data analysis where long-term trends or cycles can inform trading strategies or risk assessments.

2. **Complex Fluctuations**:
   - **Challenges**: The model struggles with complex fluctuations that involve quick and sharp changes. These are areas where the reconstructed data fails to align closely with the original, missing peaks and troughs or responding slower to sudden movements.
   - **Implication**: For trading strategies that rely on rapid responses to market changes or for capturing high-frequency trading opportunities, this limitation might reduce the efficacy of the model.

### Importance of Using LSTM AutoEncoders

- **Feature Compression**: By compressing time series data into a lower-dimensional space, LSTM AutoEncoders help in simplifying the input feature set without losing critical temporal information. This compression is crucial for efficiently handling large datasets.
- **Feature Extraction**: The encoded features (the compact representation learned by the encoder) potentially reveal intrinsic structures in the data that are not immediately apparent, offering a novel set of features that could improve predictive models.

### Pros of LSTM AutoEncoders

- **Efficient Information Representation**: Reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining important information, which is valuable in environments where processing power and memory are constraints.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Can learn to compress and decompress data without needing explicit labels, making it suitable for tasks where annotated data is scarce.

### Cons of LSTM AutoEncoders

- **Loss of Detail**: In the process of dimensionality reduction, some detailed information, especially regarding short-term fluctuations, can be lost, which might be crucial for certain predictive tasks.
- **Interpretability Issues**: The features generated by an autoencoder are not easily interpretable. This means that understanding what specific aspects of the data are captured by these features can be challenging, which complicates the model explanation and debugging.

## Features ‚Äì DTW Time Series Clustering
---

<img src="https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%20(806).png" width=80%>

### Introduction to DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a powerful statistical tool used to compare two temporal sequences which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns could be detected, even if one person was walking faster than the other. DTW is not affected by differences in signal speed or timing, making it highly effective for time series data that require synchronization of events that are similar but occur at different times.

### Application of DTW in Time Series Clustering

The aim of using DTW in time series clustering is to group similar time series based on their shapes and patterns rather than their alignment in time or amplitude. This method allows for the detection of similar behaviors in datasets where the events do not align perfectly in time.

#### How DTW Works:
- DTW calculates the optimal match between two given sequences with certain restrictions. The sequences are "warped" non-linearly in the time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non-linear variations in the time dimension.
- The algorithm maps points from one sequence to another by minimizing the total distance between them, which allows for an elastic transformation of the time axes of the sequences.

### DTW Algorithm Implementation and Its Complexity

The DTW algorithm involves creating a matrix where the `(i, j)` entry corresponds to the distance between the `i`th point of one time series and the `j`th point of another. The matrix is filled such that each cell `(i, j)` contains the distance plus the minimum cumulative distance to reach that cell from the start, allowing for alignment of the sequences that minimizes the total distance.

```python
int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m]) {

### Pros of Using DTW:
- **Shift and Distortion Tolerance**: DTW is inherently designed to handle shifts and distortions in the time axis, making it ideal for datasets where precise alignment is not possible but pattern recognition is necessary.
- **Pattern Matching**: Able to match sequences that are similar but out of phase, which is not possible with simpler distance measures like Euclidean distance.

### Cons of Using DTW:
- **Computational Complexity**: DTW has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the time series. This makes it computationally expensive for long sequences without pre-processing steps like down-sampling.
- **Resource Intensive**: Due to its quadratic complexity, it requires substantial computational resources, especially with large datasets.

### Conclusion

DTW is a robust method for comparing time series data in applications where the timing of events within the series is not consistent. Its ability to adjust for different speeds and timings in data collection makes it superior to other linear methods like Euclidean distance for many applications in financial analysis, healthcare monitoring, and more. However, the computational cost associated with DTW necessitates careful implementation, particularly with regard to the handling of data size and computing capacity.

### Overview and Application

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) K-means clustering is an advanced method to group time series data based on their structural similarities rather than absolute numerical similarities at specific points. This approach leverages the DTW distance metric to effectively handle time shifts and different paces in time series patterns, making it particularly suitable for financial data where patterns may not align perfectly due to varying market conditions.

### Observations from DTW K-means Clustering

1. **Cluster Formation**: The application of DTW with K-means to the Weighted Average Price (WAP) and Volume time series has demonstrated an ability to group similar time series based on shifted patterns. This grouping is visualized where each cluster (identified by a unique plot) has multiple time series (in grey) that are closely aligned around a central trend or pattern (the red line).

2. **Centroid Definition**: In DTW K-means clustering, the centroid (red line) is redefined as the barycenter which minimizes the DTW distance to all time series within that cluster. This differs from traditional Euclidean centroids, as the barycenter accounts for the optimal alignment of sequences, rather than averaging point-wise values.

3. **Complexity and Challenges**: A significant challenge noted is the algorithm‚Äôs struggle to encapsulate highly complex patterns or an excessive variety of patterns within a limited number of clusters. The results suggest that more granular clustering or increased cluster numbers might be necessary to capture the full range of patterns present in the data.

### Pros and Cons of Using DTW K-means Clustering

#### Pros:
- **Pattern Flexibility**: Able to identify and group time series that share similar patterns even if these patterns are shifted in time or distorted.
- **Improved Cluster Quality**: By using DTW, the clusters formed are likely to be more meaningful in terms of pattern similarity, which is crucial for pattern recognition tasks in finance.

#### Cons:
- **Computational Cost**: DTW is computationally expensive, particularly when combined with K-means, as each iteration requires recalculating DTW distances for every point to every cluster center.
- **Scalability Issues**: The method may not scale well with very large datasets or a high number of clusters without significant computational resources.

### Lessons Learned and Alternative Approaches

From the clustering results and the inherent challenges of using DTW with K-means, several key insights and potential strategies emerge:

1. **Necessity for More Clusters or Different Clustering Techniques**: Given the complexity and variety of the financial time series data, increasing the number of clusters or employing a different clustering methodology might yield better segmentation of data.

2. **Integration with LSTM AutoEncoder Features**: An alternative approach would be to use features extracted via an LSTM AutoEncoder as inputs into a traditional K-means clustering algorithm. This could reduce the computational burden while still benefiting from the deep learning model's capability to capture essential time series characteristics.

3. **Exploration of Other Clustering Algorithms**: Considering other clustering algorithms that might better handle the high dimensionality or the specific characteristics of time series data, such as hierarchical clustering or density-based methods like DBSCAN, could provide new insights.

### Conclusion

DTW K-means clustering offers a nuanced approach to analyzing time series data in finance, capturing deeper similarities in trading patterns that standard techniques might miss. However, its computational demands and the challenges in choosing an optimal number of clusters highlight the need for careful methodological choices in practical applications. Exploring hybrid approaches combining machine learning-derived features with traditional clustering could be a promising direction for future research and application.

### üìà Results and Discussion

To accurately assess the performance of our volatility prediction models, we employ the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), which offers a robust measure of prediction accuracy relative to the true observed values. This metric is particularly useful for comparing the effectiveness of our diverse set of models across different stock segments and time periods. We further refine our evaluation process by conducting cross-validation within the training set, ensuring our model's stability and robustness against overfitting. Through iterative testing and model refinement, we optimize parameters to enhance predictive performance, striving to achieve the lowest possible RMSPE.

**Based on our code files:**

1. [BaseCode](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/codeBase/BaseCode.ipynb)
2. [Features_Construction_and_EDA](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/Optiver-Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/main/codeBase/Features_Construction_and_EDA.ipynb)

We've defined a function to calculate the Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), which is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regression models when the target variable is continuous and strictly positive. The RMSPE is particularly popular in finance and stock market predictions because it normalizes the error based on the size of the true value, making it a relative error metric.

The RMSPE function calculates the square root of the average squared percentage errors between the actual values (`y_true`) and the predicted values (`y_pred`).

We then calculate the R-squared (R2) score, which provides a measure of how well the variability of the target is explained by the model's predictions. An R2 score of 1 indicates perfect correlation, while a score of 0 indicates no correlation.

- **R2 score**: With a value of 0.628, the naive model explains about 62.8% of the variability in the target. This is a fairly decent score for a naive model and indicates some level of predictive power.

- **RMSPE**: A value of 0.341 means that, on average, the predictions of the naive model deviate from the actual realized volatilities by 34.1%. This value gives an idea of the error magnitude in relation to the actual volatility values.

The performance metrics suggest that while the naive model has a certain predictive capability, there is still room for improvement. The R2 score shows a positive correlation, but the RMSPE indicates that the predictions are not very close to the actual values in percentage terms, which could be critical when making trading decisions or managing risk. The goal in a predictive modeling task would be to develop a model that increases the R2 score and decreases the RMSPE.
